This project presents the PCB design for a compact wireless sensor node tailored for HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) monitoring applications. The board is based on the nRF52832 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5.0 microcontroller, chosen for its low power consumption, reliable wireless communication, and small footprint. The PCB integrates an environmental sensor (such as a temperature, humidity, or air quality sensor), power management circuitry for battery or regulated power input, and essential components to support BLE connectivity. Designed as part of a larger wireless sensor network, this node transmits real-time environmental data to a central host computer, enabling intelligent monitoring and control of HVAC systems. The design includes a two-layer PCB layout, schematic, and ready-to-use Gerber files, created using KiCad. This hardware serves as a scalable, energy-efficient platform for IoT-based environmental sensing in smart buildings and automation systems.
